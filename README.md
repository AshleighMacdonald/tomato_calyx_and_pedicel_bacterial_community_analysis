Code in this repository was used to analyse the bacterial community of the tomato calyx and pedicel over time, both with and without ozone treatment.
See my thesis for further details 'Ozone-Mediated Control of Food Spoilage and Food-Borne Pathogens.'
The dataset showing ASVs in each sample (after taxonomic assignment) has been depositied in Oxford University Research Archive (ORA) under the title 'Bacterial community (16S rRNA analysis) of the tomato calyx and pedicel over time, after ozone treatment or not'
